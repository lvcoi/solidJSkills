# Solid PR Review Checks

1. Are signals/memos/effects used for the right purpose?
2. Are asynchronous flows cancel-safe and race-aware?
3. Are conditional/list branches robust for empty/loading/error states?
4. Are semantic HTML and labels present for controls?
5. Are exported types/components backward compatible?
