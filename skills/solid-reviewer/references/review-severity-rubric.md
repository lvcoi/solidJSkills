# Review Severity Rubric

- **Critical**: likely production failure, security issue, or data loss.
- **Major**: user-visible bug, API break, substantial performance/a11y regression.
- **Minor**: clarity, maintainability, or low-risk edge-case issue.

Escalate severity when issue affects shared components or core routing flows.
