# SolidJS Async and Data Loading

## Core tools

- `createResource` for async data tied to reactive source.
- Suspense boundaries for loading UX.
- Transitions where perceived responsiveness matters.

## Guidance

- Always define loading, success, empty, and error states.
- Keep resource ownership close to the consuming boundary unless shared.
