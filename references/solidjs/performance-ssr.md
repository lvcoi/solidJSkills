# Performance and SSR/Hydration

## Performance checks

- Minimize unnecessary reactive dependencies.
- Avoid repeated expensive computation in render paths.

## SSR/hydration checks

- Ensure deterministic initial render between server/client.
- Avoid browser-only assumptions during server render.
