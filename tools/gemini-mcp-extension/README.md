# Gemini MCP Extension (SolidJS Alignment)

This directory provides a SolidJS-aligned blueprint for a Gemini MCP/extension layer.

## Goals

- Keep Gemini-side routing aligned with the repository's SolidJS-first mission.
- Route component/refactor/review/scaffold/design requests to the corresponding SolidJS skills.
- Enforce consistent review and quality gate behavior across tool invocations.

## Contents

- `extension-blueprint.md` — architecture and integration model.
- `skill-routing-map.md` — intent-to-skill routing table.
- `prompts/solidjs-system-instructions.md` — baseline system instruction template for SolidJS tasks.

## v1 Implementation Notes

- Treat this as a reference implementation contract.
- Keep prompts concise and deterministic.
- Update routing whenever new SolidJS skills are added.
